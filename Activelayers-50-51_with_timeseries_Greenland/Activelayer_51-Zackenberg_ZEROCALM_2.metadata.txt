Description: SITE DESCRIPTION
	This grid contains two fluvial bar deposits, one at 22–20 m elevation, one at 10–12 m, with a 14o south-facing slope between them. Mainly fine-grained sediments with some cobbles and very few small boulders occur. The topographic difference between the G1 and G2 sites allows a snowpatch to accumulate on the slope in ZC2. This seasonal snowpatch is centered on the south-facing slope, extending from the Cassiope zone in the north to the moss zone in the south.
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	The site covers 120 X 150 m, with 10m grid node spacing, providing 208 grid points. Thaw depth was determined by mechanical probing. A 1-cm graduated steel rod was inserted into the soil to the point of resistance to determine the depth of thaw. All measurements were performed approximately 10 cm north of the grid nodes.
