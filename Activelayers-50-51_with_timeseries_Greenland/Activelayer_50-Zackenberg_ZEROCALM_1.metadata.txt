Description: SITE DESCRIPTION
	Site is located at 36–37 m.a.s.l. on a southwest, slightly sloping (0–2o) marine-abraded ground moraine of late Weichselian age. The site consists primarily of finegrained sediments with some cobbles and very few small boulders, and has a continuous, homogeneous cover of Cassiope heath vegetation, small (2–4 cm) white-painted stone inside the grid, and by a red-painted small stone along the grid edges. The four corners are marked by red plastic poles to increase visibility in spring, when the ground is still snow covered.
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	1-ha grid consists of a square array of surveyed points separated by 100 m, yielding an 11 × 11 array of sampling nodes on each grid. Thaw depth was measured by manual probing at each point. The values for each sampling point are averaged, yielding a maximum of 121 data points per grid per probing date.
	CLOSEST CLIMATE STATION (name, lat./long.); INCLUDE MONTHLY AIR TEMP. AND SNOW DEPTH FOR YEARS OF CALM MEASUREMENTS:  Meteorological station 90 km W-SW of grid
